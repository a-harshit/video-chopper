# Python Video Chopper

Its a simple command line Python script that splits a video into chunks of a required size. Underneath, the script uses [FFMpeg]

Run `python3 video-chopper.py file_name chunk_size (in bytes)`

Example `python3 video-chopper.py file.mp4 30000000`

This splits `file.mp4` into chunks of 30 Megabytes and each chunk will be suffixed with numeric index, for example `file0.mp4`, `file1.mp4`, etc.

If no chunk size is given then by default, video will be splitted in to chunks of 10 Megabytes.

Tip: Do set your chunk size less than required as it may go a bit above as FFMpeg splits video on the basis of frames.
